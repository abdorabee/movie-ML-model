Movie Recommender System
This is a movie recommender system built using the Surprise library in Python. It uses collaborative filtering to recommend movies to users based on their past movie ratings.

Installation
To run this project locally, you will need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

Pandas
Numpy
Surprise
Flask
You can install these libraries using pip, by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-surprise flask
Usage
To run the recommender system, you can use the app.py file. This file contains a Flask application that serves the recommendation results over HTTP. To start the server, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will start a local server on port 5000. You can access the API at http://localhost:5000/recommendations?user_id=<user_id>, where user_id is the ID of the user that you want to get recommendations for. The API will return a list of movie recommendations for that user, sorted by estimated rating.
